# Titanic-Dataset

## Introduction

The Titanic was a great and unexpected disaster in the early 1900’s. The “unsinkable” ship struck an iceberg causing fatal damage to the integrity of the ship.  This model is to accurately predict the survival of passengers aboard the ship the early morning of April 15th, 1912.

## Business Value

* Upskilling of entry level Data Scientists by tackling a binary classification problem which can then be used in real world applications.
* Encouragingcreative/”outsidethe box” thinking to feature engineer and improve model performance.

## Methodology

* Analysis of Titanic data to understand key features of surviving passengers.
* Binary classification using XGBoost.
* Feature engineering to improve model performance and accuracy.
* Bayesian Optimization of tuning parameters to target well fit models with high model scores.
 
 ## Feature Engineering
### Newfeatures:
* Title of an individual
* Family Size
* Fare cost per Person
* Parent: Mother / Father
* Family Demographics
### FeatureBin:
* Family Size
* Age

## Baseline Model
* Using XGBoost, create a baseline model to be able to compare the impact of the importance of feature engineering and it's impact on model performance.
